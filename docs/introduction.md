## Introduction

### Background

Hello! My name is Gur, and I am a consistent listener of various podcasts. I believe podcasts are one of the most reliable ways to stay updated with news and different opinions on various topics. However, the sheer volume of content makes it impossible to keep track of everything by listening alone. This led me to develop a workflow to convert YouTube podcasts into readable Hashnode blog posts. 

### Objective

The goal of this project is to save time and effort by transforming long podcast episodes into concise and informative blog posts. By focusing on key quotes and important moments, the workflow ensures that you get all the essential information without having to listen to the entire podcast.

### Scope

This method may not suit everyone, but it works exceptionally well for me. It is open-source, allowing anyone to clone it and adapt it to their own needs. If you like the format of the posts generated and want to apply it to your favorite podcast, feel free to reach out, and I can include that podcast in my subscription list.
