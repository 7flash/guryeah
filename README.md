## Introduction

GurYeaH aims to streamline the process of converting YouTube podcasts into blog posts by focusing on key quotes and moments from the conversations. It splits the transcript into manageable parts, extracts meaningful quotes, and formats them into a readable blog post. This method can save a lot of time and effort for those who prefer reading over listening.

To read more about the purpose and background of this project, please refer to [Introduction](docs/introduction.md).

## Setup and Dependencies

Before you can start using the scripts, you'll need to set up your environment and install necessary dependencies.

To get started, follow the guide in [Setup and Dependencies](docs/setup.md).

## Technical Details

Understanding the workflow is crucial for effectively using and customizing the scripts. The workflow includes these steps:

1. Extracting the transcript from YouTube.
2. Splitting the transcript into manageable sections.
3. Extracting key quotes and generating questions.
4. Extracting highlights, paragraphs, and insights.
5. Formatting the final output into a Hashnode-compatible markdown.

For a detailed explanation, visit [Workflow](docs/details.md).

## Workflow

Once everything is set up, you can run the scripts to process and publish your playlists or individual videos.


Step-by-step instructions can be found in [Running the Scripts](docs/workflow.md).
